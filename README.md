# Auxiliary Variables for Enhanced Survey Accuracy: Strategies to Combat Nonresponse Bias

## Overview

When we do surveys, we're trying to get good answers quickly from a sample of people that represent everyone. But, it's getting harder to get people to respond, especially with different ways of collecting answers like online surveys. This paper looks at how people's willingness to answer surveys has changed, especially with the shift to online surveys, and what this means for the quality of the survey results. We're also going to talk about ways to adjust when not everyone responds, to still get reliable results.
